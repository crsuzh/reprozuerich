This workshop introduces participants to the concept of (open) research data and familiarizes them with some of the important aspects of research data management with a specific focus on publishing and sharing data. The workshop will provide participants with insights and some hands-on exercises on data repositories, the legal and ethical aspects of sharing data (e.g. licenses, sensitive data) and how to make data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable).

In this workshop, participants will learn the basics of dynamic reporting using either the R Markdown, Quarto, or knitr format. All of these formats can be used to perform data analysis and report writing in a single document. This helps researchers and students to better document their analysis, automate boring and error-prone tasks, and improve computational reproducibility. Prerequisite for this course is basic knowledge of data analysis with either R, Python, or Julia.

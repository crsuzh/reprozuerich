Replication studies are increasingly conducted in order to confirm original findings. The
purpose of this workshop is to describe and compare statistical approaches for the design and analysis
of replication studies. The standard method based on significance is discussed, as well as alternative
approaches based on effect sizes or meta-analysis. Participants will learn how to use the R-package
ReplicationSuccess and will apply the methods to real data from large-scale replication projects.
Prerequisites include basic knowledge of R and familiarity with standard concepts of statistical
inference.

Preregistration in science is the practice of publicly documenting the plan for a study before data collection and examination. This plan can include details such as the research questions, hypotheses, study design, and data analysis protocol. The preregistration document is time-stamped and uploaded to an independent platform for public access (e.g. OSF), either immediately or after a set embargo period. The goal of preregistration is to increase transparency and reproducibility in scientific research by making the research plan available for review and critique before the study is conducted, which can help to mitigate issues such as confirmation bias and p-hacking.
 
This hands-on workshop will provide a comprehensive introduction to the practice of preregistration and show how to preregister a study on the Open Science Framework (OSF). Attendees will learn about:
 
- different types of preregistration and appropriate templates for their research
- add metadata
- which information should be included in the protocol
- how to upload files
- how to make the preregistration public
 
The workshop will also provide opportunities for attendees to share their own experiences and have any questions or challenges addressed.
 
Attendees are encouraged to bring a laptop and register for a free [OSF](https://www.osf.io) account.
